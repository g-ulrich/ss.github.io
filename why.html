                        Between 1937 and 2012 and estimated 1,600 bodies have been found floating in 
                        the San Francisco Bay. The reason for this grim reality is due to those who 
                        commit suicide every year by jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge. 
                        In the same time frame thousands of others have committed suicide in 
                        a Japanese forest called Aokigahara. Also, each year 1,250,000 people have 
                        died from car crashes. Additionally,  this year, close to 10,000,000 
                        people died of cancer and while you were reading this page <span style="color:red;" class="font-weight-bold" id="dying"></span> 
                        more people died of random causes.

                <p>
                        Yes, that was depressing. However, these realities are some of many that spurred 
                        the creation of ServingSIlent.com. But what’s the connection?

                <h2>Connection</h2>
                <p>
                        Everyone dies once, but not everyone dies twice. As Jesus eluded to in Revelations 20:6, 
                </p>
                <p class="pl-4 text-center font-italic color-gold">
                        “Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second Death, the lake of fire.”
                </p>
                <p>
                        Since some will not be apart of the second death what does that mean for me? This is were it gets personal, so hang in there. 
                        You must realize that all have fallen short of the glory of God.
                </p>
                <p class="pl-4 text-center font-italic color-gold"> 
                        Jesus said, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. - John 14:6 
                <br/> <br/>
                        If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. - Romans 10:9
                <br/> <br/>
                        There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. -Acts 4:12

                        For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:
                        “Death is swallowed up in victory.”
                <br/>
                        “O death, where is your victory?
                <br/>
                        O death, where is your sting?”
                <br/>
                        The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. -1Cor. 15:53-57

                <br/>
                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>
                        “Serving Silent” is an oxymoron in reference to our mandate as Christ followers and if you have been in a bible teaching church you may have heard the 
                        immortal words of Jesus from Matthew 28:18-20, 
                </p>
                <p class="pl-4 text-center font-italic color-gold">
                        "Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
                </p>       
                <p>
                        The point is
                </p>
                <p class="pl-4 text-center font-italic color-gold">
                            “We are not to Love in words or speech, but with actions and in truth.” – 1 John 3:18
                </p>
                <p>
                        Thus ServingSilent.com is born out of a need for actions and truth in an age of endless information without application. So, this dying world can see our Love in action and understand the living savior in His truth. Lets obey the mandate God has given us and start by putting our faith into action.
