                <p class="first-letter">
                    Allow me to paint you a picture. Hopefully this will enlighten you on the nature of this website. 
                    Between 1937 and 2012 and estimated 1,600 bodies were recovered who had jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/goldengatebridge.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid float-right text-right p-3" alt="[Golden Gate Bridge Sunset]" title="[Golden Gate Bridge Sunset]"/>
                    

                    <p>If you were to jump from this bridge you would experience a four-second fall plunging 245 ft (75m) traveling
                     75 mph (121 km/h). Followed by the equivalent impact of a speeding truck hitting a concrete wall.</p>
                     <p>
                    Now, the question arises: what if you were on the Golden Gate Bridge and see someone about to jump 
                    to their death, what is your next move?
                    </p>
             
    
                <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase mt-5 mb-4 bl-b-footer">Connection</h2>
                <p>I believe your next move would be to save that person no matter the cost. That’s why you are going
                     to Love this connection. You see “Serving Silent” is an oxymoron in reference to our mandate as Christ followers. </p>
                <p>More than likely if you have been in a bible teaching church you have heard the immortal words of Jesus from Matthew 28:18-20, </p>
                
                <p class="pl-4"> 
                "<i class="color-gold">Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
                Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
                and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.</i>"</p>
    

                <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase mt-5 mb-4 bl-b-footer">Why</h2>
                    <p>“That’s great, ” you may say, but what does a story about suicide have to do with “Serving Silent?” My simple answer is this, 
                        without Christ, we are all deliberately jumping to our deaths. Not into a watery grave, but into an eternal
                         fire.</p>


                <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase mt-5 mb-4 bl-b-footer">Word</h2>
                        <p>However, don’t let me convince you with my words, instead read Gods word.</p>


                <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase mt-5 mb-4 bl-b-footer">Summation</h2>
                        <p>The Christian life is not merely a passive one, It is a bold call to action. To prepare for battle, to equip 
                            ourselves with the sword of the spirit for the freedom of others in Christ. </p>
